> Newborn photo session is one of the most famous photo session.
>
> Best time for this session is within the first 7-20 days of birth, as this is the time when the babies are still in their sleepiest state and can easily be posed in beautiful, curly newborn poses. All the props for the newborn session is provided by me - baskets, crates, blankets, wraps, headbands, bonnets, etc. Once your contact is received, I add your due date to my schedule. As soon as your baby had arrived, you email/sms me with that information and we schedule the actual date of your newborns session. All newborn sessions are scheduled for 10 AM. The newborn session is never rushed, I allow both soothing and feeding breaks throughout. Your baby's comfort and safety is very important to me. Upon arrival your newborn will immediately be embraced by the warm temperature. I offer soother with womb sounds and other calming sounds for more pleasure of your child. If you are breastfeeding, please leave the feeding after arriving, not before. During the session I take the baby through variety of poses and some prop shots, capturing multiple angles to give your proofing gallery variety of images. I conclude the photo session only after i have the feeling that I captures enough beautiful images to fill your gallery. Photographing newborn plus parents and siblings takes approximately 2-3 hours.
