## Hello,

My name is Tatyana Tomšíčkova and I am from Bulgaria. I got married in the Czech Republic and I currently live and work in Prague.

I am a mother of three boys. I am mostly photographing newborns, children and families. You can have a look at the gallery to see some of my work. Also you can follow my newest work on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/tatyanatomsickovaphotography).

If you would like to have pictures taken by me, you can send me an email and we can arrange a photo session. You can reach me through the [**contact form**](/contact).

Everyone deserves to have perfect pictures. So don't hesitate and call in order to capture some happy moments of your life or the life of your precious kids and to have beautiful memories for life!
