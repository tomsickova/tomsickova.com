Reservations will again run through Calendly. After booking, a deposit of 500 CZK must be paid within 3 days. The deposit is non-refundable and will be deducted from the total package price.
If you need to cancel, I will offer you an alternative date that suits both parties. If you do not attend the rescheduled session, the deposit will be forfeited. The remaining balance is payable in cash no later than the day of the photoshoot.
