👗 Clothing:
I recommend light tones — white, beige, pink, light blue, cream, brown, or green. Most colors work well, just please avoid large logos or prints — solid colors are best.

Suitable outfits include dresses, shirts, trousers, and polo shirts — white, beige, cream, and pastel shades 🤍

🎄 Booking 🎄

Reservations are handled via Calendly. After booking, a 500 CZK deposit must be paid within 3 days. The deposit is non-refundable and will be deducted from the total package price. If you need to cancel, I will offer you an alternative date that suits both sides. If you do not attend the rescheduled session, the deposit will unfortunately be forfeited. The remaining balance is payable in cash no later than the day of the shoot.
